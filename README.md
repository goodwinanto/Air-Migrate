# AirMigrate

![Project Status: In Progress](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-in--progress-yellow)

**AirMigrate** is a cross-platform Python desktop application designed to safely transfer and organize media files (photos and videos) from an iPhone to your computer without using iCloud. It leverages [ifuse](https://github.com/libimobiledevice/ifuse) to mount your iPhone's file system and provides a robust, privacy-focused workflow for copying or moving files.

## Project Status

This project is currently **in progress**. Functionality and documentation are evolving.  
Expect bugs and incomplete features.

## Features

- **Scan & Summarize:** Scans the iPhone DCIM folder for all media (photos, videos, Live Photos, Portraits, Panoramas, RAW, etc.) and provides a folder-level and total summary before transferring.
- **Media Classification:** Categorizes media types for flexible organization.
- **Copy or Move:** Allows you to either copy or move media files, with robust verification (hash-based) to ensure data integrity.
- **Live Photo Handling:** Handles paired files (HEIC+MOV) for Live Photos.
- **Progress Feedback:** Shows progress bar and per-file status during transfer.
- **Error Handling:** Logs every operation, error, hash mismatch, and summary in a log file (`airmigrate.log`).
- **Privacy Respecting:** No cloud, no analytics, all processing is local.

## Typical Workflow

1. **Mount your iPhone** using [ifuse](https://github.com/libimobiledevice/ifuse).
2. **Launch AirMigrate** and select your source (iPhone/DCIM) and destination folders.
3. **Scan and review** your media files and summary.
4. **Choose Copy or Move**, then start the operation.
5. **Monitor progress** and review the log for details.
