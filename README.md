# AirMigrate

**AirMigrate** is a cross-platform (Linux, macOS, Windows) Python desktop tool that safely transfers and organizes media files (photos, videos, etc.) from an iPhone to your PC. It works without iCloud, using [ifuse](https://github.com/libimobiledevice/ifuse) to mount your iPhone, and ensures zero data loss, privacy, and a clean user experience.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Scan iPhone DCIM folder:** Detect all Apple-style subfolders (e.g., 100APPLE, 101APPLE).
- **Media categorization:** Counts and previews for:
  - Photos (.HEIC)
  - Videos (.MOV)
  - Live Photos (.HEIC + .MOV)
  - Portraits, Panoramas, Raw/ProRAW, Cinematic, Slow-Mo, Time-lapse, Burst, Selfies, Screenshots, Screen Recordings, GIFs
- **Folder-level & total summary:** See counts and total size before transfer.
- **Flexible transfer:** Copy/move all or selected subfolders.
- **Destination options:**
  - Replicate iPhone folder structure or organize by type/date.
  - Pick or create a destination folder easily.
  - Warn if destination is not empty and check for enough free space.
- **Data integrity:**
  - Verifies each file by hash or size+timestamp.
  - Live Photos always transferred as pairs.
  - Moves only after successful copy and verification.
- **Error handling:** Robust detection of permission, device, or file system errors.
- **Progress feedback:** See per-folder and overall progress, with estimated time.
- **Privacy first:** No cloud, no analytics, no data sent anywhere.
